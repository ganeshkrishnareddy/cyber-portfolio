- **Infrastructure**: Configured for automated CI/CD via **Netlify** and **GitHub Actions**

## 🏗️ Core Engineering Features

### 1. Terminal-Driven Interface
Implements a custom React-based Terminal component that mimics a Linux environment, providing a technical deep-dive into the engineer's role, core focus areas, and automated audit simulations.

### 2. High-Impact Security Case Studies
Utilizes a structured "Threat-Methodology-Result" (TMR) hierarchy to communicate complex technical assessments effectively to both technical managers and HR recruiters.
- **Threat Vector Analysis**: Highlighting real-world risks (IDOR, MITM, XSS).
- **Technical Methodology**: Documenting tools (Burp Suite, Frida, JADX) and frameworks (OWASP ASVS).
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Quantifying impact (e.g., "Eliminated 99% of local data theft vectors").

### 3. SEO & Semantic Integrity
- **JSON-LD Schema**: Integrated Breadcrumb and Article schemas for enhanced SERP visibility.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA+ compliant contrast ratios and keyboard-navigation focus states.
- **Performance**: Near-perfect Lighthouse scores through static page generation and image optimization.
